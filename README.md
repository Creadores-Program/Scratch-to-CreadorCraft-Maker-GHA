Github Action to transpile your Scratch game to CreatorCraft game on Github!

If you want to know how to create a game in CreadorCraft I recommend you check out the [CreadorCraft Maker wiki](https://creadorcraft-maker.blogspot.com/p/documentacionwiki.html) you can also run many programming languages for your game!

## Example Work
You need a Scratch game file .sb, .sb2 or .sb3
### Action options

- id: Scratch Game ID if you want to get by Project ID
- url: Scratch game file URL if you want to get it by url
- pathGame: Scratch game directory if it is in your Github repo
- pathCustomJs: additional JavaScript file directory for the Scratch game (must be in a different directory than where the CraftCreator game will be generated, same for the css)
- pathCustomCSS: additional css to the Scratch game

        with:
          name: My Game Example
